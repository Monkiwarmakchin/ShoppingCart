# ShoppingCart
A basic web shop of 5 articles that implements a shopping cart system with sessions through servlets.
Was made in Apache Netbeans, so this is the entire project that is needed to be import in that software.
Also it was added the document that explain the functioning of the program.
There's a more detailed (and humorous) video of that explanation, but apparently it's too big for github.
